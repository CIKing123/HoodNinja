# HoodNinja
Game platformer

*Hood Ninja* is a pixelated 2D black-and-white platformer that blends fast-paced parkour and gritty combat in a stylized urban landscape. Players step into the shoes of a Black gang member turned ninjaâ€”not a hero, not a villain, just a man trying to survive the harsh realities of gang life. Battling both rival crews and a mix of corrupt and honest cops, he moves through a city of shadows, leaping rooftops, scaling walls, and striking with precision. The game delivers tight, fluid mechanics and raw storytelling, exploring themes of survival, identity, and moral ambiguity in a world where every choice is a risk.
